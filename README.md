## Things To Note

This is not a fully fledged version of any of the core features in the app. It is designed to be a quick and light all-in-one solution. It is not designed for heavy usage all the time,  and the features here probably wonâ€™t stand up to those use cases. However, proper apps for each of these core features could be considered in the future.
